# slash-commands
A personal module for using slash commands on discord. Since this is for personal use, it will not be published on pypi.

## Installation and Usage
The module is not in a usable condition right now, so I haven't really thought of some method to install it

As of usage, even after it is in a usable state, I'm still not going to spend time on any kind of documentation.
